**2. Optional Fields**
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your SQL Database URL. Follow this [Generate Database](https://github.com/anasty17/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/tree/master#generate-database) to generate database. Data will be saved in Database: auth and sudo users, leech settings including thumbnails for each user, rss data and incomplete tasks. **NOTE**: If deploying on heroku and using heroku postgresql delete this variable from **config.env** file. **DATABASE_URL** will be grabbed from heroku variables.
- `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`: Fill user_id and chat_id of groups/users you want to authorize. Separate them by space.
- `SUDO_USERS`: Fill user_id of users whom you want to give sudo permission. Separate them by space.

### Update
- `UPSTREAM_REPO`: Your github repository link, if your repo is private add `https://username:{githubtoken}@github.com/{username}/{reponame}` format. Get token from [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). So you can update your bot from filled repository on each restart. **NOTE**: Any change in docker or requirements you need to deploy/build again with updated repo to take effect. DON'T delete .gitignore file. For more information read [THIS](https://github.com/anasty17/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/tree/master#upstream-repo-recommended).

- `CUSTOM_FILENAME`: Add custom word to leeched file name.

### qBittorrent
- `BASE_URL_OF_BOT`: Valid BASE URL where the bot is deployed to use qbittorrent web selection. Format of URL should be `http://myip`, where `myip` is the IP/Domain(public) of your bot or if you have chosen port other than `80` so write it in this format `http://myip:port` (`http` and not `https`). This Var is optional on VPS and required for Heroku specially to avoid app sleeping/idling. For Heroku fill `https://yourappname.herokuapp.com`. Still got idling? You can use http://cron-job.org to ping your Heroku app.
- `SERVER_PORT`: Only For VPS even if `IS_VPS` is `False`, which is the **BASE_URL_OF_BOT** Port.
- `WEB_PINCODE`: If empty or `False` means no more pincode required while qbit web selection. `Bool`
- `QB_SEED`: QB torrent will be seeded after and while uploading until reaching specific ratio or time, edit `MaxRatio` or `GlobalMaxSeedingMinutes` or both from qbittorrent.conf (`-1` means no limit, but u can cancel manually by gid). **NOTE**: 1. Don't change `MaxRatioAction`, 2. Only works with `/qbmirror` and `/qbzipmirror`. Default is `False`. `Bool`
  - **Qbittorrent NOTE**: If your facing ram exceeded issue then set limit for `MaxConnecs`, decrease `AsyncIOThreadsCount` in qbittorrent config and set limit of `DiskWriteCacheSize` to `32`.

### RSS
- `RSS_DELAY`: Time in seconds for rss refresh interval. Recommended `900` second at least. Default is `900` in sec.
- `RSS_COMMAND`: Choose command for the desired action.
- `RSS_CHAT_ID`: Chat ID where rss links will be sent. If using channel then add channel id.
- `USER_SESSION_STRING`: To send rss links from your telegram account. Instead of adding bot to channel then linking the channel to group to get rss link since bot will not read command from itself or other bot. To generate session string use this command `python3 generate_string_session.py` after mounting repo folder for sure.
  - **RSS NOTE**: `DATABASE_URL` and `RSS_CHAT_ID` is required, otherwise all rss commands will not work. You must use bot in group. You can add the bot to a channel and link this channel to group so messages sent by bot to channel will be forwarded to group without using `USER_STRING_SESSION`.

### Private Files
- `ACCOUNTS_ZIP_URL`: Only if you want to load your Service Account externally from an Index Link or by any direct download link NOT webpage link. Archive the accounts folder to ZIP file. Fill this with the direct download link of zip file. If index need authentication so add direct download as shown below:
  - `https://username:password@example.workers.dev/...`
- `TOKEN_PICKLE_URL`: Only if you want to load your **token.pickle** externally from an Index Link. Fill this with the direct link of that file.
- `MULTI_SEARCH_URL`: Check `drive_folder` setup [here](https://github.com/anasty17/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/tree/master#multi-search-ids). Write **drive_folder** file [here](https://gist.github.com/). Open the raw file of that gist, it's URL will be your required variable. Should be in this form after removing commit id: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/username/gist-id/raw/drive_folder
- `YT_COOKIES_URL`: Youtube authentication cookies. Check setup [Here](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl). Use gist raw link and remove commit id from the link, so you can edit it from gists only.
- `NETRC_URL`: To create .netrc file contains authentication for aria2c and yt-dlp. Use gist raw link and remove commit id from the link, so you can edit it from gists only. **NOTE**: After editing .nterc you need to restart the docker or if deployed on heroku so restart dyno in case your edits related to aria2c authentication.
  - **NOTE**: All above url variables used incase you want edit them in future easily without deploying again or if you want to deploy from public fork. If deploying using cli or private fork you can leave these variables empty add token.pickle, accounts folder, drive_folder, .netrc and cookies.txt directly to root but you can't update them without rebuild OR simply leave all above variables and use private UPSTREAM_REPO.

### MEGA
- `MEGA_API_KEY`: Mega.nz API key to mirror mega.nz links. Get it from [Mega SDK Page](https://mega.nz/sdk)
- `MEGA_EMAIL_ID`: E-Mail ID used to sign up on mega.nz for using premium account.
- `MEGA_PASSWORD`: Password for mega.nz account.

### GDTOT
- `CRYPT`: Cookie for gdtot google drive link generator. Follow these [steps](https://github.com/anasty17/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/tree/master#gdtot-cookies).

### Buttons
- `VIEW_LINK`: View Link button to open file Index Link in browser instead of direct download link, you can figure out if it's compatible with your Index code or not, open any video from you Index and check if its URL ends with `?a=view`, if yes make it `True`. Compatible with [BhadooIndex](https://gitlab.com/ParveenBhadooOfficial/Google-Drive-Index) Code. Default is `False`. `Bool`

### Torrent Search
- `SEARCH_API_LINK`: Search api app link. Get your api from deploying this [repository](https://github.com/Ryuk-me/Torrent-Api-py).
  - Supported Sites:
  >1337x, Piratebay, Nyaasi, Torlock, Torrent Galaxy, Zooqle, Kickass, Bitsearch, MagnetDL, Libgen, YTS, Limetorrent, TorrentFunk, Glodls, TorrentProject and YourBittorrent
- `SEARCH_LIMIT`: Search limit for search api, limit for each site and not overall result limit. Default is zero (Default api limit for each site).
- `SEARCH_PLUGINS`: List of qBittorrent search plugins (github raw links). I have added some plugins, you can remove/add plugins as you want. Main Source: [qBittorrent Search Plugins (Official/Unofficial)](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins).

------

### 3. Getting Google OAuth API credential file and token.pickle

**NOTES**
- Old authentication changed, now we can't use bot or replit to generate token.pickle. You need OS with a browser.
- Windows users should install python3 and pip. You can find how to install and use them from google or from this [telegraph](https://telegra.ph/Create-Telegram-Mirror-Leech-Bot-by-Deploying-App-with-Heroku-Branch-using-Github-Workflow-12-06) from [Wiszky](https://github.com/vishnoe115) tutorial.
- You can ONLY open the generated link from `generate_drive_token.py` in local browser.

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
3. Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
4. Choose Desktop and Create.
5. Publish your OAuth consent screen App to prevent **token.pickle** from expire
6. Use the download button to download your credentials.
7. Move that file to the root of mirrorbot, and rename it to **credentials.json**
8. Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
9. Search for Google Drive Api and enable it
10. Finally, run the script to generate **token.pickle** file for Google Drive:
```
pip3 install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```
------

## Deploying on VPS

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
1. You must set `SERVER_PORT` variable to `80` or any other port you want to use.
2. To clear the container (this will not affect on the image):
```
sudo docker container prune
```
3. To delete the images:
```
sudo docker image prune -a
```
4. Check the number of processing units of your machine with `nproc` cmd and times it by 4, then edit `AsyncIOThreadsCount` in qBittorrent.conf.
5. Use `anasty17/mltb:arm64` for oracle or arm64/v8.
   - Tutorial Video for Deploying on Oracle VPS:
     - Thanks to [Wiszky](https://github.com/vishnoe115)
     - No need to use sudo su, you can also use sudo before each cmd!

## UPSTREAM REPO (Recommended)

- `UPSTREAM_REPO` variable can be used for edit/add any file in repository.
- You can add private/public repository link to grab/overwrite all files from it.
- You can skip adding the privates files like token.pickle or accounts folder before deploying, also no need to add variables direct links except **config.env**, simply fill `UPSTREAM_REPO` private one in case you want to grab all files including private files.
- If you added private files while deploying and you have added private `UPSTREAM_REPO` and your private files in this private repository, so your private files will be overwritten from this repository. Also if you are using URL variables like `TOKEN_PICKLE_URL` then all files from those variables will override the private files that added before deploying or from private `UPSTREAM_REPO`.
- If you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with the official repository link then be carefull incase any change in requirements.txt your bot will not start after restart. In this case you need to deploy again with updated code to install the new requirements or simply by changing the `UPSTREAM_REPO` to you fork link with that old updates or make it empty if deployed master branch.
- In case you you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with your fork link be carefull also if you fetched the commits from the official repository.
- The changes in your `UPSTREAM_REPO` will take affect only after restart.
- `UPSTREAM_BRANCH` don't ever fill heroku here.

## Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
>For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = "True" in config file or environment variables.
>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

### 1. Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account?](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can upload 75 TB a day or clone 2 TB from each file creator (uploader email).

#### Two methods to create service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)
- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

##### 2. Create Service Accounts in New Project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

### 2. Add Service Accounts

#### Two methods to add service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)
- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
- `For Windows using PowerShell`
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```
- `For Linux`
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd ..
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager and delete email.txt file from accounts folder

##### 2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```
------

### Generate Database

**1. Using Railway**
- Go to [railway](https://railway.app) and create account
- Start new project
- Press on `Provision PostgreSQL`
- After creating database press on `PostgresSQL`
- Go to `Connect` column
- Copy `Postgres Connection URL` and fill `DATABASE_URL` variable with it

**2. Using Heroku PostgreSQL**
<p><a href="https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/See%20Dev.to-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=dev.to" width="160""/></a></p>

**3. Using ElephantSQL**
- Go to [elephantsql](https://elephantsql.com) and create account
- Hit `Create New Instance`
- Follow the further instructions in the screen
- Hit `Select Region`
- Hit `Review`
- Hit `Create instance`
- Select your database name
- Copy your database url, and fill `DATABASE_URL` variable with it

------

## Multi Search IDs
To use list from multi TD/folder. Run driveid.py in your terminal and follow it. It will generate **drive_folder** file or u can simply create `drive_folder` file in working directory and fill it, check below format:
```
MyTdName folderID/tdID IndexLink(if available)
MyTdName2 folderID/tdID IndexLink(if available)
```
-----

## Yt-dlp and Aria2c Authentication Using .netrc File
For using your premium accounts in yt-dlp or for protected Index Links, create .netrc file according to following format:

**Note**: Create .netrc and not netrc, this file will be hidden, so view hidden files to edit it after creation.

Format:
```
machine host login username password my_password
```
Example:
```
machine instagram login anas.tayyar password mypassword
```
**Instagram Note**: You must login even if you want to download public posts and after first try you must confirm that this was you logged in from different ip(you can confirm from phone app).

**Youtube Note**: For `youtube` authentication use [cookies.txt](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl) file.

Using Aria2c you can also use built in feature from bot with or without username. Here example for index link without username.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. instagram, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.

-----

## Gdtot Cookies
To Clone or Leech gdtot link follow these steps:
1. Login/Register to [gdtot](https://new.gdtot.top).
2. Copy this script and paste it in browser address bar.
   - **Note**: After pasting it check at the beginning of the script in broswer address bar if `javascript:` exists or not, if not so write it as shown below.
   ```javascript
   javascript:(function () {
    const input = document.createElement('input');
    COOKIE = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({cookie : document.cookie}));
    input.value = COOKIE['cookie'].split('crypt=')[1];
    document.body.appendChild(input);
    input.focus();
    input.select();
    var result = document.execCommand('copy');
    document.body.removeChild(input);
     if(result)
       alert('Crypt copied to clipboard');
     else
       prompt('Failed to copy Crypt. Manually copy below Crypt\n\n', input.value);
   })();
   ```
   - After pressing enter your browser will prompt a alert.
3. Now you'll get Crypt value in your clipboard
   ```
   NGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWdSVT0%3D
   ```
4. From this you have to paste value for **CRYPT** in config.env file.
